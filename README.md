# PixelPass

Secure, reproducable, password generation from lossless image files

Password generation with PixelPass is a 3 step process.

# 1: Select image source for password generation.
# 2. Enter your desired password length.
# 3: Choose whether to include special characters.

The tool will let you know how long your password can be according to the deminsions of your chosen image.
It automatically updates as you change files, input password length, and toggle special characters.
More updates will come. The next step in the development process is revamping the UI.

# Note:
PixelPass currently only supports png and bmp files. I plan to add more in the future but hope the most common
are good enough for now!
